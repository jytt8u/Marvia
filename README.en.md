**Your own VPN, end to end: protocol, nodes, panel, and apps for Android and Windows.**

Whoever hands out access installs the panel with one script and adds each node
with a line copied from the panel. Whoever connects gets a single link: the app
picks a node by itself and, if it stops responding, looks for a working one.

## Architecture

<img src="docs/shots/readme-flow.svg" alt="Technical diagram: access control is separate from the VPN data path" width="1200">

The panel grants access; VPN packets pass through a node, not the panel.
[Trust boundaries](docs/architecture.md).

## VP1 security

<img src="docs/shots/readme-security-en.svg" alt="Noise inside TLS, with a comparison of VP1, WireGuard, VLESS and Trojan security mechanisms" width="1200">

**A separate Noise session inside TLS:** node-key verification and payload
encryption do not rely solely on the outer TLS channel. This is an architectural
distinction, not proof that VP1 is safer than every alternative.
[Comparison, sources and protection boundaries](docs/security-comparison.md).

VP1 access records contain **0 client private keys**; nodes only need public keys.
[Automated checks, 26 Sep 2026](docs/security-checks/2026-09-26/README.md):
0 reachable known vulnerabilities after dependency updates;
8.55 million executions across four fuzz targets with no failure found. This is not an independent audit.

**What the seller sees and what they don't.** The panel stores no buyer
addresses; the node keeps them only for the device limit, in memory, for an
hour; logs record neither addresses nor sites. What any exit node can still
see, and what a VPN does not protect — [docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md).

## A faster VP1

<img src="docs/shots/readme-vp1-progress.svg" alt="VP1 before and after optimization: 435.0 → 678.3 MB/s, +55.9% in a local test; medians and ranges of five paired runs" width="1200">

**56% more throughput than the previous VP1 build in a local test.** Fewer unnecessary TLS records; encryption and wire compatibility are unchanged. The optimization is retained in current development; this is not a measurement of the old v0.12.2 build.

Five paired 512 MiB runs on one PC, without Internet or TUN.
This is a local throughput gain, not a promise of 56% faster Internet.

[Before/after data](docs/benchmarks/2026-09-26-record-fit/README.md) ·
[Full comparison with VLESS and Trojan](docs/performance.md) · [Benchmark source](cmd/marvia-bench)
VLESS and Trojan remain faster than VP1 in the full local comparison.

## Protocols

WireGuard and OpenVPN tunnel IP packets; the others below are proxies. On
Android, Marvia also creates a system VPN interface for third-party proxy keys.

| Protocol | Transport and distinction | Marvia support |
|---|---|---|
| **[VP1](docs/protocol.md)** | Noise proxy over TLS/REALITY, WebSocket or QUIC; falls back to TCP if QUIC/UDP is unavailable | First-party node, Android and Windows |
| [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/protocol/) | IP tunnel over UDP; no built-in HTTPS disguise | Android: third-party key, seller's Renew and Support |
| [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/community-docs/community-articles/openvpn-2-7-manual.html) | IP tunnel over UDP or TCP with TLS; a separate protocol, not ordinary HTTPS | Not integrated |
| [VLESS + REALITY](https://xtls.github.io/en/config/transports/reality.html) | TCP proxy with TLS handshake disguised as a target site | Node and Android |
| [Trojan](https://github.com/trojan-gfw/trojan/blob/master/docs/protocol.md) | Proxy inside TLS with a cover site | Node and Android |
| [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/doc/what-is-shadowsocks.html) | Encrypted TCP/UDP proxy; does not resemble HTTPS on its own | Android: third-party key |
| [Hysteria 2](https://v2.hysteria.network/docs/developers/Protocol/) | QUIC/UDP proxy with HTTP/3 appearance; requires working UDP | Android: third-party key |

WireGuard, OpenVPN, Hysteria 2 and Xray were not run in this benchmark.
VP1 is not compatible with WireGuard or Xray clients.

## What is included

| Client | Server |
|---|---|
| Android: Marvia and third-party keys, node selection, usage and VPN settings, name lookups over HTTPS hidden from the node, seller's Renew and Support | Panel and nodes: limits, accounting, plans and two-click renewal, QR code and Telegram text, backups, bot API, migration from Marzban and 3x-ui; support and renew links and an announcement in the subscription for Happ, v2RayTun, Hiddify |
| Windows: TUN client, Russian sites and home network directly, DNS choice and encrypted name lookups, split TLS hello, several keys, weekly traffic, IPv6 and reports switches, seller's Support and Renew | VP1, VLESS and Trojan; verified node updates |

Manually selected nodes connect without waiting for measurements of every
other node. If the selected node is unavailable, the client checks fallbacks.

## Compared with other projects

| Project | Focus | Notable capability |
|---|---|---|
| **Marvia** | Panel + nodes + first-party Android/Windows + VP1 | One stack for users and operators |
| [Marzban](https://github.com/Gozargah/Marzban) | Xray panel | Scheduled quotas and Telegram integration |
| [Remnawave](https://docs.rw/) | Xray panel and nodes | Mihomo/sing-box templates, device controls |
| [3x-ui](https://docs.sanaei.dev/docs/) | Xray panel | Broad protocol and administration support |

Marvia still lacks automatic monthly quota resets. Buyers move from Marzban and 3x-ui with their existing keys and
subscription addresses — [what changes on the way (Russian)](docs/guide.md#переезд-с-marzban-и-3x-ui). The linked project documentation
supports the feature comparison; no matched speed ranking is available.

## Get started

> **Have a key?** Download the [Android APK](https://github.com/jytt8u/marvia/releases/download/v0.13.0-alpha.5/marvia-android.apk)
> or the [Windows installer](https://github.com/jytt8u/marvia/releases/tag/v0.13.0-alpha.5) (`marvia-windows-setup.exe`;
> [details (Russian)](docs/start-from-zero.md#6-выпустить-доступ-себе-и-подключить-клиент)),
> add a `marvia://…` link in the app, and connect.

Android also accepts VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks, Hysteria2 and WireGuard
links. The app is not yet on Google Play.

The public alpha.5 is a test release.
Verification on real devices is not complete. Known limitations are in the
[changelog (Russian)](CHANGELOG.md).

### Verify the files

**The APK** has been signed with the same key since the first release. Signing
certificate SHA-256 fingerprint:

```
53:EB:5B:D4:4A:38:1C:BA:E1:9B:76:06:EF:20:91:9E:33:DF:FB:26:0D:49:F2:D4:AD:86:88:85:36:4D:7E:82
```

Check it on the phone with [AppVerifier](https://github.com/soupslurpr/AppVerifier)
or on a computer with `apksigner verify --print-certs marvia-android.apk` from
the Android SDK. A different fingerprint means it is not our file. Once
installed, Android refuses updates signed with another key.

**The APK from 0.13.0-alpha.2 on, panel, node and Windows** files are built
on GitHub from the tag. APKs of earlier releases were built by the author
locally: their signature proves who released them, not which source they were
built from. The
checksums of all files are signed through Sigstore, proving this repository's
build produced them:

```bash
gh attestation verify SHA256SUMS --bundle SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json --repo jytt8u/marvia && sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

### Install the panel

Use a Linux server and a domain with an A record. Download the installer from
the [test release v0.12.2](https://github.com/jytt8u/marvia/releases/tag/v0.12.2).
On a single VPS, use 8443 for the panel and 443 for the node. See the
[full preparation and checksum instructions](docs/start-from-zero.md):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/jytt8u/marvia/releases/download/v0.12.2/install-panel.sh -o install-panel.sh
sudo sh install-panel.sh --domain panel.example.com --email you@example.com --port 8443 --from https://github.com/jytt8u/marvia/releases/download/v0.12.2/marvia_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Save the admin token displayed during installation, then create a node and a
client in the panel. [Full guide (Russian)](docs/guide.md) · [Bot API](docs/bot.md).

## Still to do

- Google Play: physical-device verification, declarations
  and testing. [Publication plan (Russian)](docs/google-play.md).
- Monthly quota resets. Migration from Marzban and 3x-ui does not carry over VMess,
  Shadowsocks, Vision links, or MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.
- iOS, importing Clash/sing-box subscriptions in our apps, TUIC, Shadowsocks plugins, and per-device
  revocation when a key is shared.
- On Windows: apps around the tunnel, a kill switch, monthly statistics and
  reading a key from a QR image — for now these exist on the phone only.
- Encrypted name lookups (DoH) are covered by tests but not yet checked on a
  real phone and PC. They hide names from the node, not site addresses or the
  name in the TLS hello (SNI): the node still sees those.

For a future verified 1.x release, the bot API, `marvia://` links and subscription format are intended to
remain backward compatible throughout 1.x. Marvia does not sell VPN access,
take payments or host servers.
